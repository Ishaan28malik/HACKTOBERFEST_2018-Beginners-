Data structure and algorithms is an important part of programing so here are some searching and sorting techniques every programmer should know.</br>

*Note: THE PROGRAMS ARE IN C*
*There are other sorting and searching algorithms as well, in this I have considered the most common ones.*

Here's a brief about each searching and sorting technique mentioned in this folder. </br>

1. *Linear serach*: The idea of the algorithm is to iterate across the array fromleft to right, searching for a specified element. It is a time taking algorithm best suited to use it when searching within less data.
2. *Binary search*: The idea of the algorithm is to divide and conquer, reducing the search area by half each time, when finding the target number. *But the list must be sorted berforehand.*

1. *Selection sort*: The main idea behind selection sort in to find the smallest number in an array and place it to the lowest possible index i.e. in ascending order.
2. *Bubble sort*: The idea of algorithm is to move higher valued elements generally towards right and lower value elements generally towards the left.
3. *Insertion sort*: The idea of thee algorithm is to build your sorted array in place, shifting elements out of the way if necessary to make room as you go.
4. *Merge sort*: The idea of the algorithm is to sort the smaller arrays and then combine those arrays together(merge them) in the sorted order. *Recursion* takes place in this sorting algorithm.
5. *Quick sort*: Like merge sort, Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partition the given array around the picked pivot.
6. *Heap sort*: It is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm and it requires the knowledge of arrays and trees. Swap, remove and heapify are the repeated steps in this sorting algorithm</br>

Now see the codes for proper understanding.
